# YouTube Limiter
This project is a browser extension.<br>
This browser extension sits passively in the background while you do your work, but if you spend more than one hour on YouTube in a day, it will close all your YouTube tabs, preventing you from using YouTube until the next day.

Future plans for this include:
- An options page to change the time limits.
- Support for limiting other sites.
- A warning for when your time is almost up.

Overall this extension is designed to help reduce distraction and procrastination from important work.
